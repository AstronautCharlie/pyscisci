# pySciSci

Note: Package is currently under construction.

The Science of Science (SciSci) is based on a transdisciplinary approach that uses large data sets to study the mechanisms underlying the doing of scienceâ€”from the choice of a research problem to career trajectories and progress within a field[[1]](#1).

Here, we offer a python package to unify access to several of the major Bibliometric DataBases, including:
- [Microsoft Academic Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/academic-services/graph/) (MAG)
- Clarivate [Web of Science](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/web-of-science/) (WoS), note: ToDo
- [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de)
- [American Physical Society](https://journals.aps.org/datasets) (APS), note: ToDo
